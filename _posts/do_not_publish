Hi Mate, 
May be my OSINT is not state of the art but I cannot find your email in the internet. I'm researching Surfbeam modems and generally Sat Comm. 
I would like to share with you what I found until now and invite you to the project that with good winds will be suitable for a talke on BlackHat. 
I see that you have preety good interest in RE of embeded devices and also playing with SDR's and that why I strongly beleieve that you might be interested in my small project. There are so many different security domains to touch that I cannot handle it just by myself.
I'm based in Barcelona Spain and you can contact me via bs |at| bsasecure.com
